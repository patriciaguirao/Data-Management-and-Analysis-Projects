# Project-4

This is a project I did for my Data Management and Analysis class. In courses.ipynb, I did a data exploration and analysis on web pages written in HTML (NYU Spring 2021 Computer Science Course Offerings and the Computer Science Course Catalog). In films.ipynb, I requested json data from a website (movie and movie rating data) and did data exploration and analysis on said data. I used Python, notably pandas, for both.
