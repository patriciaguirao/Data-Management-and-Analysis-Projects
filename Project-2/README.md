# Project-2

This is a project I made for my Data Management and Analysis file where I used Python and some associated libraries (numpy, matplotlib) to explore and answer some questions about a dataset of Ben N' Jerry's Ice cream flavors (https://www.kaggle.com/tysonpo/ice-cream-dataset/version/3).
